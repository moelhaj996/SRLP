**Project**: Self-Refinement for LLM Planners Framework  
**Author**: Mohamed Elhaj Suliman  
**Institution**: Master's Thesis in Computer Science â€“ AI & Big Data  
**Year**: 2025  

## Project Description

This framework was developed as part of my master's thesis research, focusing on self-refinement mechanisms for Large Language Model planners. The project implements automated self-checking feedback loops and iterative refinement strategies to improve planning quality across multiple domains.

## Key Contributions

- **Multi-Provider LLM Integration**: Implemented support for OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and Mock providers
- **Self-Refinement Engine**: Developed iterative refinement algorithms with convergence detection
- **Comprehensive Evaluation Framework**: Created metrics and visualization tools for comparative analysis
- **Cross-Domain Testing**: Implemented scenarios for travel, cooking, project management, and event planning
- **Academic Documentation**: Generated thesis-ready reports and visualizations

## Technical Implementation

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Key Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **API Integrations**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Generative AI
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and test suites
